// Passport is a authentication Middleware
// Something which is run before the request data reaches action

// Now passpport has a lot of stratiges we will use these
// 1.) Passport local
// 2.) Passport jwt
// 3.) Passport google auth

// Now to use passport we have to install both passport and passport strategy

// npm install passport
// npm install passport-local

// Passport local have some same thing as manual authentication
// 1.) Passport js uses session cookie
// session cookie stores all the seesion information
// and it is encrypted whihc is far good as compare to  local authenication so no one can decrypt it

// Expression Session Cookie makes the session cookie and encrypts the cookie not the passport so we have to install it

//  ------------------------------- Middleware which takes session cookie and encrypts it-------------------------------
// app.use(
//   session({
//     name: "Social",
//     secret: "blah something",
//     saveUninitialized: false,
//     resave: false,
//     cookie: {
//       maxAge: 1000 * 60 * 100,
//     },
//   })
// );
//1.) Uninitialized -> If user is uninitialized(not logged in) then i do not want to any other data into the cookie
// 2.) if loged in means cookie hass session data so if sessin data present we will not save same data again and again

// If we restart the server then thoses cookies will vanish 
so we have to store these cookies permanently

so we will use mongostore and mongo connect


PrePopulate -> Prepopulating the refered object 
example -> When i am showing all the post 
then i want to show user name aas well but we have only user id so if we want to show user name as well then we have to pre populate user
